## Symbolic Container Language (SCL) 
### NeuroDev Framework

#### Overview

This [Wiki](https://github.com/betatester3016/SCL/wiki) defines a meta-language "symbolic language structure" for representing abstract, emotional, behavioral, or computational content using a compact nested container syntax for use with an AI.

#### Background

Conventional methods of interaction with AI often lead to unpredictable outcomes. Symbolic Container Language (SCL) addresses these challenges by providing a structured and reliable framework.

It combines a few simple rules into a formal instruction and programming language through the use of variables, containers, operators, labels, and statements with a simple BASIC instruction set.

This hybrid system supports a wide range of functions, including symbolic reasoning, emotional modeling, behavioral scripting, and logic chaining in a compressed and expressive format. Its flexible structure also allows it to define goals, perceptions, and beliefs, or facilitate memory encoding and hierarchical planning.

### Symbolic Routines Using B.A.S.I.C. Instruction Sets

With this symbolic structure, more complex routines can be constructed using simplified control logic — similar in spirit to B.A.S.I.C. (Beginner’s All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code).

##### The BASIC Programming Language

Created in 1964 by John Kemeny and Thomas Kurtz at Dartmouth College, BASIC was a user-friendly programming language designed to make computing accessible to beginners. Its simple, interpreted nature was fundamental to the early personal computer revolution and its concepts continue to influence modern languages like Java and Python.

##### Basic Language (as in Simple Language)

As a principle of communication, Basic Language is characterized by its use of simple words, common phrases, and straightforward grammar. Its purpose is to ensure clear and effective communication, making complex information easily understood by a wide audience, regardless of their expertise.
